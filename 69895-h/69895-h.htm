<h2 class="nobreak">THE FARM AND THE WOODLOT</h2>


<h3 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p>Undoubtedly, one of the most important phases of the
forestry work, so far as the individual States are concerned,
is the question of the woodlot and its improvement. In the
Eastern States—that is, those east of the Mississippi River—a
very considerable portion of the forested areas within each
State is in the form of woodlots which are a part of and an
adjunct to the farm so that in any comprehensive forest policy
for the Eastern United States a great deal of attention must
be focused upon this phase of the work. This is, undoubtedly,
true so far as Kentucky is concerned where, as a whole, the
land is held in fee simple by the citizens of the State as farms
from a few acres in size up to several thousand acres. By the
majority of the owners of these farms, the value and importance
of the woodlot is little understood nor has the practice
of forestry as it applies to these woodlots any significance
whatsoever. The object of this bulletin is to make clear just
what forestry is, the relation of scientific forestry to the improvement
of the woodlot and the economical part which the
farm woodlot plays in the industrial and social welfare of the
State. As a matter of fact, this is one of the most difficult
features of the work to present properly, because it is a hard
matter to make clear to the average individual just why a
woodlot is an asset in connection with his property and how
the improvement and care of his woodlot concerns him closely
and means a proportional increase directly in the actual money
value of the material on hand and indirectly in ways which
do not present themselves readily unless the attention is
focused on them—as for example, the value of a woodlot as
a wind-break in connection with an orchard or in connection
with the farm as a whole, or the value of a wooded area on an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
easily eroded hillside as a fixative for the soil and a preventative
against the deterioration of the cultivated areas below
it. The effort then of this bulletin will be—first, to show how
the average woodlot may be brought to a standard of productivity
compatible with the complete utilization of the
ground, and second, to show in detail what the direct and indirect
benefits of a woodlot in connection with any farm will be
under the best circumstances. In the preparation of this bulletin,
free use has been made of all bulletins and publications
on this subject, which the writer has been able to get hold of
and acknowledgment is made to these as a whole, since it
would be impracticable to make complete individual acknowledgement.</p>


<h3>WHAT IS FORESTRY?</h3>

<p>To the average individual, forestry as a science does not
mean very much. The impression is that it has to do with the
trees, but to what extent and how it deals with this question
is by no means thoroughly understood. In the first place, forestry
deals with trees as a community and not as an individual—that
is, it deals with them in the bulk and in this respect
differs from kindred sciences where the individual tree is a
matter of concern. The forester is often called upon to answer
questions and discuss matters with relation to shade trees or
ornamental trees, but this is not a matter within his province
properly, but is a matter for the landscape architect or horticulturist.
Forestry primarily concerns itself with the planting
and growing of trees for sale at a profit. Occasionally
forestry may concern itself with the growing and raising of
trees for purposes where the money value of the crop, while it
may not be as evident as where the trees are placed on the
market and sold, is nevertheless, a real money consideration.
This is the case, where certain areas are planted for the purification
and conservation of a city water supply. Here the
actual worth of the forest is the value to the people of the
city or community of pure drinking water. This will be the
case in the Catskill Mountains where enormous expenditures
are being made for supplying New York City with pure water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and where the purity of this water supply depends upon the
maintenance of certain areas in forest growth. Forestry then,
so far as it relates to the farm and woodlot, may be defined
as dealing with trees as communities and the growing and
marketing of these trees for a profit. It is a simple proposition,
the same as raising corn. In raising corn, the ground
is prepared, the seed is planted at a certain time in the spring,
the necessary attention is given during the growing season
and in the fall it is harvested and sold. A certain price is
obtained for the grain and a certain price for the stalks,
usually in the form of fodder for stock. The chief value of the
corn crop depends upon the number of bushels per acre of
corn (grain) that have been produced and the kind and quality
of corn there is to market. The kind and quality of the corn
crop depends on the selection of seed. All this is accomplished
within a year’s time—the planting, the harvesting, the cultivation
and the sale of the product. Forestry is exactly the
same proposition. The stock is selected, the trees are planted,
the necessary attention is given them during the growing
period, and eventually the crop is harvested and marketed for
the best price obtainable. The value of the timber crop depends
on how much material you raise to the acre, the kind
and quality of the product you have to market and the demand
in the market for the class of material to which the
timber crop is particularly adapted. The chief difference is
this: that, whereas, the corn crop has been planted, harvested
and marketed within one growing season, a forest crop takes
a period of growing seasons before it is ready to market. The
precise length of this period depends on the kind of material
you are to raise, as fence posts, ties, lumber, etc.</p>


<h3>IMPROVEMENT OF THE WOODLOT.</h3>

<p>What then can be done to show the man most concerned,
the farmer, the importance of the improvement of his woodlot?
First, an attempt will be made to set forth the matter
as clearly as possible in print, which is the object of this
bulletin; and the necessary steps will then be taken to furnish
an ocular demonstration of the facts herein set forth by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
establishment of nurseries and the maintenance of model
woodlots. On the big majority of farms in Kentucky, there
are certain areas which are not good farm land and never will
be for a variety of reasons (inferior soil, rocky soil, too steep
a slope, etc.); but these lands in most cases can produce timber
crops and should be producing them, since they are a commercial
adjunct to the farm and bring in a revenue. As Mr. W.
F. Cook, of Hickman County, says, “It is a great deal more
valuable than giving the land over to weeds and wild briars.”</p>

<p>Ordinarily, there is little or no attention paid to the woodlot
on a farm, and without attention a woodlot is in much the
same condition as a corn field in which no attention was paid
to the kind of corn planted, and which was not cultivated
during the growing season. You commonly find in a woodlot
a great variety of trees, some of a valuable species and some
of more or less worthless species. You also find crooked and
defective and diseased trees, and further you ordinarily do
not find in any particular woodlot one-half the trees that the
ground will support, which is about the worst feature of all,
since here is an economic waste.</p>


<h3>PURPOSES OF THE WOODLOT.</h3>

<p>When the improvement of the woodlot is seriously under
consideration, one of the first propositions is to determine just
what purpose the woodlot will serve in the economy of the
farm. Ordinarily a woodlot will be maintained for the following
reasons: 1. To furnish fence posts; 2. To furnish fuel;
3. As a shelter belt for certain areas or for the whole farm;
4. As a protection on steep up-lands against erosion; 5. As a
means of regeneration of worn out land; 6. As an investment
pure and simple, without regard to immediate returns; 7. For
the aesthetic value. Any combination of these reasons may
prevail for the maintenance of a woodlot; however, each one
of them will be discussed in its turn as separate propositions.</p>

<p>1. Probably one of the chief reasons for maintaining the
woodlot on farms in Kentucky from the purely utilitarian
standpoint will be to obtain fence posts. These are a commodity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
on the farm which cannot be dispensed with and for which
the demand is staple. Concrete may and will at some future
date, supersede wood as fence posts, especially in rich easily
accessible agricultural regions where farming is very profitable
and conducted as a business, but it will do this only
slowly in remote regions, and at the present time concrete
posts are not extensively used in any locality. A woodlot
can then be reasonably maintained for the production of fence
posts. Ordinarily the posts are largely consumed on the
home farm, since they are more valuable to the producer at
this point than if he should sell them; however, if there is a
surplus, a market for this will not be lacking and the price
obtained will more than justify the cost of the establishment
of the woodlot and its maintenance up to the time of harvesting
the crop. In considering the species which lend themselves
most readily to the production of this class of products
in Kentucky, undoubtedly, black locust (Robinia pseudacacia)
sometimes locally called yellow locust, lends itself most readily
to this purpose. It is indigenous to the State, grows
fairly rapidly and lasts a long time in contact with the soil,
three prime requisites of any species which is to be used in
the growing of this class of material. Other species which may
be used are catalpa (Catalpa speciosa), walnut, osage orange,
chestnut and juniper (also known locally as cedar or red
cedar).</p>

<p>2. As a general proposition, it appears that the maintenance
of a woodlot for the growing of fuel, so far as Kentucky
is concerned, is not an important consideration. So far
as my observation goes throughout the State—even in the
rural districts—coal is the general fuel in use on account of
the abundance of supply and is in a large number of ways
cheaper and preferable to wood as a fuel. On this account
the woodlot will supply only a very small amount of fuel
and consideration of this matter is not important. If it does
happen that a supply of fuel wood is desirable or necessary
on the farm, undoubtedly, hickory and oak lend themselves
most readily for this purpose. Any species of hickory grows
fairly rapidly, and certain species of oak, as for instance red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
oak, makes a reasonably rapid growth. A woodlot for this
purpose would be managed as a sprout forest.</p>

<p>3. The removal of forests and wooded areas of Kentucky
has undoubtedly resulted in certain climatic changes. These
are principally to be noticed in the prevalence of high winds
which formerly did not exist, and such winds have a marked
effect on certain farm activities, as for instance the handling
of an orchard or the handling of stock. A shelter belt, therefore,
offers protection to the farm house and surrounding
buildings. To be of use, the shelter belt or wind break must
be in the direction of the prevailing winds. Further, since
in all probability a shelter belt is of most use and is most desirable
in the winter time, the component species in the shelter
belt should be, to a large extent, evergreens, so that the effectiveness
may be as great in winter as in summer. In connection
with an orchard, a shelter belt or wind break, undoubtedly,
protects against cold and destructive currents of
air which injure the orchard in various ways either by injuring
the blossoms of the fruit, or at a later period, by injuring
the fruit, which is blown from the trees by the wind
and left in bad condition for shipping.</p>

<p>The species then which should compose a shelter belt
should, as far as possible, have these characteristics. They
should grow fast to furnish the maximum amount of protection
in the shortest space of time, and should have as wide a usefulness
as possible. So far as the majority of instances are
concerned, the shelter belt might have two objects. The production
of useful material for the farm as fence posts as well
as a wind break. In this case, it would be well to plant black
locust in conjunction with some evergreens, as white pine or
Norway spruce, hemlock or yellow pine. The number of
evergreens which may be utilized for this purpose in Kentucky
are limited, but the number of hardwoods which lend themselves
to this purpose is very great, as for instance, the hickories,
ashes, black locust, poplars, tulip poplar, osage orange
and others. Beech also makes a good tree for the composition
of a shelter belt.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>4. As a protection on a steep up-lands against erosion,
the chief thing is to establish a forest cover. The composition
of the stand is more or less immaterial although it is
always desirable that the most readily marketable species
shall be used so that the woodlands in addition to performing
their protective function may also supply an actual revenue.
Therefore, as far as possible, the trees to be used should be
the ashes, oak, chestnut, hickories, maples and other species,
whose value in the lumber market is standard. The chief
feature in regard to this protective woodland is that the
forest cover shall remain unbroken.</p>

<p>5. As a means of regeneration of worn out land, especially
hillsides, which are liable to erosion and do not lend
themselves easily to a scientific rotation of crops, a forest
cover is a very important factor since it furnishes to the soil
the essential humus and, when such species as the black locust
or honey locust are planted, it furnishes the nitrogenous elements
to the soil, since the locusts are legumes and produce
on their roots nodules of nitrifying organisms similar to those
found on the roots of alfalfa, cow-peas or soy beans.</p>

<p>6. As a general proposition, the raising of lumber or timber
by an individual is out of the question on account of the
length of time which it takes to grow the better grades of
this material. Ordinarily, a tree fifty years old will furnish
only the poorest grades of lumber and usually only small
dimension stock. Generally speaking, one hundred years is
not too small a calculation for the length of rotation when
lumber is the aim. In the event that any individual plants
trees for the production of the lumber, such planting is done
as an investment purely and simply since he can not expect
to see the crop harvested within his life time. The only monetary
benefit that could possibly accrue to the owner is from
the material which may have to be thinned out or in the event
that he should desire to sell his farm when the existence of a
grove or woodland of healthy young trees would represent an
actual money value to the purchaser. In case planting for this
reason is made, the trees should be those which are the most
valuable lumber producing species, as for instance, the oaks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the ashes, hickory, sweet gum, tulip poplar, white and yellow
pines, basswood and a few others.</p>

<p>7. It may be that in connection with the farm the presence
of a grove of trees thereon will represent a value from the
aesthetic and science standpoint where the beauty of the landscape
is a matter of consideration to the owner of the land, or
to any one who might desire to purchase it. In this event
the kind of tree is not so important as the actual presence of
trees of some kind. The general effect is the main consideration,
without regard to the individual features which compose
this effect.</p>


<h3>FOREST TAXATION.</h3>

<p>One of the most important factors in connection with the
consideration of woodlots is the matter of taxation, and this
is a matter which so far as Kentucky is concerned, has had
little attention. In the first place, there is no classification of
land within the State for taxation purposes. It is a generally
accepted theory among experts in this matter at the present
time that there is only one fair method of taxation which may
be applied to land maintained by the owner in forest growth
and that is that there should be a tax placed on the land which
shall be an annual tax, and another tax placed on the forest
crop <b>when it is harvested</b>. In no other manner does it seem
probable that reforestation of suitable areas throughout the
State may be accomplished, since in the first place, on account
of the character of the investment the owner of the land must
be assured before hand just what his taxes on the land are to
be, and in the second place the risks attendant upon the raising
of a forest crop, because of the long period of years before
it reaches maturity, make it essential that the crop of forest
products shall be taxed at maturity when it is harvested, rather
than that an annual tax shall be imposed. Certain States
have already gone a long ways in this direction and Pennsylvania
has recently passed three laws dealing with the matter
of forest taxation and the classification of forest land which
embrace the best features of recent thought on this subject.
The essentials of the recent Pennsylvania laws are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>1. Classification of suitable land set aside by the owner
for forest purposes as auxiliary forest reserves.</p>

<p>2. Agreement with the State to maintain such land in
forest growth and penalties for failure to carry out agreement.</p>

<p>3. Assessment of land classified as auxiliary forest reserves
at $1.00 per acre annual tax.</p>

<p>4. Payment by owner of 10 per cent of the value of the
forest products when harvested to the county to be distributed
among the proper county funds.</p>

<p>5. Fixed charge on auxiliary forest reserve land of two
cents per acre for schools and two cents per acre for roads.</p>

<p>Under these provisions it is obvious that the growing of
timber on suitable areas would be reduced to a practical business
basis.</p>

<p>Providing the tax question is sufficiently settled and definite
for a period of years the regeneration of the woodlot or
the establishment of one may be undertaken as a safe investment.
So far as Kentucky is concerned, the present tax laws
and the manner of handling the assessments in the counties
are not such as to bear heavily on timbered or wooded areas.
In the event that a new classification of land is made and new
tax laws enacted every effort should be made to bring about
such a classification of forest land and such a system of taxation
as will encourage the reforestation of suitable areas and
the regeneration of the present woodlands.</p>


<h3>REGENERATION OF THE WOODLOT.</h3>

<p>When the question of the regeneration of the woodlot
is seriously considered there are several points which stand
out prominently as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Protection.</li>
<li>Taking of stock.</li>
<li>Removal of undesirable species.</li>
<li>Selection of desirable species.</li>
<li>Method of regeneration.</li>
<li>Care and management.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>1. <b>Protection.</b> It is essential that a woodlot shall be protected
if it is to be an asset to the owner and brings him
financial returns. There are two destructive agencies against
which he must make special efforts, fire and stock. It may
seem unnecessary to point out the various bad effects which
fire and stock have on woodlands, but they are nevertheless
here set forth in brief. <b>Fire</b> destroys timber utterly, injures
it so that it is subject to insect and fungi attacks, lowers the
grade of the timber, destroys or seriously injures reproduction,
destroys humus and lowers the productive capacity of the
soil. There is no way in which burning over a woodland improves
the character of the forest. <b>Stock</b> have a very injurious
effect on trees, especially young growth. Some stock
eat up the nuts and berries and seeds which are the means of
reproducing the forest. Other stock browse on the young
trees which have started, destroying the young growth altogether
or seriously gnawing other trees thereby leaving them
badly malformed and depleted in vitality. By rubbing against
small trees stock also do a great deal of harm. So stock should
be rigidly excluded from the woodlot, or at least until all
the trees are well developed and even then no good is accomplished.
If possible, the woodlot should be well fenced. The
other destructive agencies against which protection may become
necessary are insects and disease. If fire and stock are
excluded, the chances of insects and disease doing serious
damage is materially decreased. Diseases and insects are
best kept in check by keeping the wooded area clean of dead
and decaying material. In case of serious insect infestation it
may in some cases pay to spray the trees, but under ordinary
conditions this is not practical. The common way of fighting
disease and insects is to cut down and burn all affected trees.</p>

<p>2. <b>Taking of Stock.</b> The next step in the regeneration
of our woodland is to find out the extent and character of
the stock on hand, for we can not proceed intelligently without
this knowledge. This taking of stock may be a purely
ocular process or it may be a detailed estimate and description,
depending on the extent of the woodland and the desires
of the owner. All reproduction should be accounted for as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
as the older stock on hand. The taking of stock should also
involve the division of species into desirable and undesirable
species, by desirable species being meant such species as it is
desired to encourage because of the demand for it in the local
market or because of the use which may be made of it by
the owner on his farm. The desirable species will usually include
the fast growing species.</p>

<p>3. <b>Removal of Undesirable Species and Trees.</b> The first
actual work in connection with the regeneration of the woodlot
is the removal of undesirable species. When this is undertaken
the local market and other markets should be carefully
studied in order that, if possible, a sale may be found for the
material which is removed, so that the work may pay for itself.
In determining what are undesirable species there are several
factors which will govern and no specific list of trees can be
cited. The desire of the owner, the market for the material,
rapidity of growth and other features are among the important
considerations. Such trees as blue beach, horn beam, red
bud, service berry and others have no rightful place in a
woodlot since they take up space without furnishing any product
of value, unless the wooded area is desired for its aesthetic
features. In a woodlot which is maintained for fence
posts and fuel it would be poor policy to retain any but those
species which make good fence post material and fuel and grow
rapidly. In this matter, common sense will go a long way.
Also badly suppressed trees, malformed and diseased or infected
individuals should be removed as far as practicable.</p>

<p>4. <b>Selection of Desirable Species.</b> In the selection of desirable
species there are a large number of considerations, and
the first of these is the purpose of the owner in maintaining
the woodlot. For instance, if the owner desires fence posts,
and fencing material, his woodlot will, in Kentucky, be confined
to those species which produce such material <b>quickly</b>,
as for example black locust, catalpa, chestnut and walnut,
also it will be well to have a percentage of red cedar (juniper)
in the mixture, for since red cedar grows comparatively
slowly, it may be reserved to be cut as the second crop and will
serve to shade the ground and prevent erosion when the faster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
growing species have been cut and during the restocking
of the area. If fuel as well as fence post material is desired,
a mixture including hickory, oak and chestnut would
be desirable. If ties, posts, poles or other products are an
object, certain species are desirable and are easily grown. A
list of trees suitable for various purposes is herewith given.
No species are included in this list which will not produce
marketable material repeatedly within the lifetime of a single
individual. Only in unusual cases is the raising of trees for
lumber recommended as a feasible or profitable venture for
the individual farm owner.</p>

<p>Fence posts and fencing material—Black locust, catalpa,
chestnut, walnut, oak, red cedar (juniper).</p>

<p>Fuel—Oak, hickory, maple, chestnut.</p>

<p>Poles—Chestnut, catalpa, red cedar.</p>

<p>Ties—Black locust, catalpa, chestnut, walnut, oak.</p>

<p>Vehicle material and handle stock—Hickory.</p>

<p>5. <b>Methods of Regeneration.</b> There are several things
which must be done to secure a good forest over the area. If
natural seeding is to be depended upon for reproduction, the
ground must be prepared to receive the seed. Sometimes the
sod will be so thick over the area that seeds get no chance
to generate. In this case, the sod should be plowed up, if possible,
or harrowed so that the seeds may have a suitable opportunity
to start. To do well, it is necessary that the seeds and
seedlings have easy access to the mineral soil. It may be that
the ground is so shaded that seedlings do not receive the necessary
sunlight. If this be so, sufficiently large openings
should be made in the forest cover to admit the required
light. It may be that natural seeding does not proceed rapidly
enough and that this must be supplemented by the sowing
of seed artificially. When artificial sowing is resorted to
it will be found that there are several methods of sowing
which recommend themselves: broadcast, sowing in prepared
rows, sowing in prepared seed spots and sowing with a corn
planter either in rows or spots. This last method is recommended
as being usually most satisfactory and economical.
Sowing with a corn planter can be resorted to only in the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of small seeds. Large seeds, such as walnuts, hickory nuts,
etc., must be planted by hand, but when this is done they are
liable to be eaten by squirrels or other rodents, in which case
it may be necessary to plant such seeds in small protected
seed beds and then transplant the seedlings to the place
where they are desired.</p>

<p>If planting is to be depended upon for reforesting, the
nursery stock obtained should be small seedlings not over one
or two years old or transplants two to three years old. If the
amount of planting to be done is large, it may be wise to
start seed beds close to the ground where the planting is to be
done and not to depend on commercial nurseries for stock.</p>

<p>6. <b>Care and Management.</b> It will be found that the care
and management of the woodlot is relatively a simple matter
after the forest is well established and that the character of
the stock and the amount and quality of the products will
improve materially with management. There are certain
systems of management which recommend themselves for
woodlots such as the (1) simple coppice (2) pole wood coppice
(3) coppice with standards or variations of these. The three
methods here cited are briefly described.</p>

<p><b>Simple Coppice.</b> This is a system of management wherein
all the stand is cut and the restocking of the area is secured by
sprouts from the old stumps. Under this system the stand
should be cut at an age not to exceed twenty-five years and
preferably about fifteen years, although this is usually impossible
from a commercial standpoint. The cutting should
be done in the late fall, winter or early spring. The stumps
should be cut low, smooth and slanting so as to shed water
and prevent decay. After a time under this system the sprouting
capacity of the stump is greatly reduced and arrangement
must be made to secure new individuals either by direct seeding
or by planting.</p>

<p><b>Pole Wood Coppice.</b> This system involves the leaving of
certain trees until they reach the pole wood stage and are
suitable for such products as ties, poles, etc. It is a favorite
method of handling woodlots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><b>Pole Wood Standards.</b> This system involves the leaving
of a certain few trees until they are of large size. Such
trees should usually be from the seed.</p>

<p>In the management of the woodland, it will be necessary
to make several cuttings before the final cutting at the end of
the rotation, usually one or two. A thinning may early become
necessary to give the best specimens a better chance
for growth. Sometimes two thinnings may be required. Often
a thinning may be required to secure reproduction by opening
up the forest cover and exposing the ground so that young
growth may have the opportunity to get started.</p>

<p>In the final cutting, when all or the major part of the crop
is cut, the material should be removed from the ground as
rapidly as possible and the brush disposed of when practical.
The disposal of brush will usually take the form of lopping
the limbs from the tops and scattering them, so as to secure
early decay of the waste material. Sometimes the brush
may be advantageously piled and burned.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>No attempt has been made in this bulletin to deal exhaustively
with the woodlot problem. The desire has been to
point the way for the improvement of the woodlots in Kentucky.
Individual cases deserve specific consideration, and
only the main features of the proposition have been touched
upon. The State Forester will cheerfully answer by mail all
questions relating to this subject so far as it is possible to do
so, and will give such personal advice and direction as the time
at his disposal and the circumstances warrant. A list of books,
bulletins and articles treating this subject is appended for
those who desire to go more deeply into the matter than is
possible in a publication of this character. The illustrations

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
